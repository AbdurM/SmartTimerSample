Weekend 005 of #WeekendMobileUIChallenge. 


Xamarin controls used:

Neocontrols (Pre-release)
Pancakeview



I have challenged myself to write Code for one UI using either Xamarin Forms or SwiftUI every weekend. I will be picking up designs from websites such as dribbble.com where skilled designers post their work.
